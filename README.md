## Website description

I mimicked the Airbnb website. I liked its minimalist yet beautiful design. I focused on having the landing page contain only a few elements to make it easy to navigate. I included hover effects in the navigation bar and on different buttons to refine the design. 

On small screen sizes, the navigation bar turns into a hamburger menu and elements in the footer are displayed vertically. 


# Extra Credit

I implemented the CSS check-box hack for the hamburger menu
